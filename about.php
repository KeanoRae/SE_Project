                    on a piece of glass that serves as a canvass. A short history about glass painting, one type of 
                    it that has existed since the ancient Rome and China times is the reverse glass painting, which 
                    is similar to its normal counterpart, but only requires viewing it with the glass turned over. 
                    Historians cannot give a definite time when glass painting began. Traces of creating colored 
                    glass figures have been found in ancient cultures, such as Rome, Byzantium, China and throughout 
                    the middle Ages. As it goes by these glass paintings are expanding and having many types and 
                    design already.
